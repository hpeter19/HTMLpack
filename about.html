        Sauti Sol is a renowned Kenyan Afropop band formed in Nairobi in
         2005 by Bien-Aimé Baraza, Willis Chimano, and Savara Mudigi, 
         initially as an a cappella group. Guitarist Polycarp Otieno
          later joined, completing the quartet. They debuted with Mwanzo
           (2008), followed by Sol Filosofia (2011), which earned critical
            acclaim and awards. Their 2015 album, Live and Die in Afrika, was
             released as a free download, boosting their popularity.
             Known for hits like "Sura Yako" and "Melanin," Sauti Sol has toured Africa,
              Europe, and the U.S., collaborating with artists like Spoek Mathambo and 
              Ladysmith Black Mambazo. They’ve won multiple awards (Kisima, BET, MTV EMA) 
              and gained global recognition while maintaining strong Kenyan roots. 
              The band members, all university graduates, met in school and refined 
              their sound at Alliance Française before rising to fame.
